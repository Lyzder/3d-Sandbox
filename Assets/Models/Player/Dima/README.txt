Meet Dima.

Dima is a free character meant to be part of the testing team of a game project. He comes ready to be modified, rigged, textured and animated with a cool and fresh low poly style.
Dima has less than 1.5k polys (2665 tris), is fully UV unwrapped and is easily riggeable with Mixamo or Rigify.
His humanoid proportions (1.8 meters tall) make him ideal for integrated character systems in engines like Unreal or Unity.
The package contains a .blend and .obj Dima file and a base 1024 diff texture in .png format.
